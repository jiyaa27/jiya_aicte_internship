Human Pose Estimation Using Machine Learning

Overview

This project implements Human Pose Estimation using MediaPipe, Streamlit, and Matplotlib. The application captures real-time video input, detects key body points (joints), and visualizes the pose estimation on a web-based UI.

Features

Real-time pose estimation using MediaPipe

Interactive UI built with Streamlit

Graphical visualization using Matplotlib

Webcam support for live pose tracking

Keypoint analysis for understanding body posture
